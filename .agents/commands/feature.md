Begin tracking a new feature as a GitHub issue.

1. Read the [`Feature` template](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.md)
2. Read the project's [high-level design doc](/docs/Design.md) to make sure you have a general understanding of the project.
3. If the feature is not obvious: review project documentation, search relevant code, and/or recent commits to better understand it.
4. Come up with a 1-3 (ideally) word title that concisely describes the feature.
5. Create a new issue, following the `Feature` template.
6. Display the title, TL;DR and a hyperlink to the user.

That's it.
