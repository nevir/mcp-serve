<!--
`Research` `Task` issues are ALWAYS sub-issues of another issue (typically `Spec` or `Design`).
-->

## Research Question

<!--
Define the specific question(s) or decisions that need research. Be concrete about scope.
Example: "What are the most secure and user-friendly methods for implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) in a web application?"
-->

## Methodology

<!--
Describe how you'll research this. What will you compare/analyze? What sources will you check?
Examples: "Analyze 2FA implementations in 5+ popular web services", "Survey security best practices for storing user credentials", "Test different 2FA libraries for ease of integration and security features"
-->

## Findings

<!--
Document what you discovered during research. Include relevant examples, data, or observations.
This should be the raw research before you draw conclusions.
-->

## Options & Trade-offs

<!--
Present the viable approaches you found, with honest pros/cons for each.
Use subsections for each option:
-->

### Option: [Name]

<!--
Description of approach
**Pros:**
- Benefit 1
- Benefit 2

**Cons:**
- Drawback 1
- Drawback 2
-->

### Option: [Name]

<!-- Repeat pattern above -->

## Recommendation

<!--
Based on your research, what approach do you recommend and why?
Include implementation details if relevant. Be clear about the reasoning that led to this choice.
