As this feature is developed, additional work will be tracked via sub-issues:

- `Spec`: A sub-issue that defines the "what" and "why" of the feature, including scope and acceptance criteria.
- `Design`: A sub-issue that is a technical blueprint outlining "how" the feature will be engineered and implemented.
- `Task`(s): Many sub-issues that track the actionable work required to implement the feature.
  - Tasks may themselves have other `Task` sub-issues (e.g. to represent 'epics').
