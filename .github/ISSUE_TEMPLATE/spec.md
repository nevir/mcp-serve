<!--
`Spec` issues are ALWAYS a sub-issue of the `Feature` issue they describe.
There is only one `Spec` per `Feature`.

Principles:
✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY (user value, business needs)
❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
🤔 Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make.

## User Scenarios

### Primary User Journey

<!--
Describe the main user flow in plain language.
Example: "A developer installs mcp-serve via Homebrew and wants to use shell completion to discover commands efficiently."
-->

### Acceptance Scenarios

<!--
Write testable scenarios using Given/When/Then format. Include edge cases like boundary conditions and error scenarios.

Examples:
1. _Given_ fresh shell after Homebrew install, _when_ user types `mcp-serve <TAB>`, _then_ completion shows available commands
2. _Given_ invalid mcp-serve config, _when_ user attempts completion, _then_ shows graceful fallback or error message -->

1. _Given_ [initial state], _when_ [action], _then_ [expected outcome]
2. …

## Requirements

### Essential

<!--
List capabilities that MUST work for the feature to be considered complete. Derive these from your scenarios above.
