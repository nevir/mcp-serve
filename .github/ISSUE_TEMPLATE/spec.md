<!--
`Spec` issues are ALWAYS a sub-issue of the `Feature` issue they describe.
There is only one `Spec` per `Feature`.

Principles:
✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY (user value, business needs)
❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
🤔 Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make.

## User Scenarios

### Primary User Journey

<!--
Describe the main user flow in plain language.
Example: "A new user signs up for the service, creates a profile, and invites a team member."
-->

### Acceptance Scenarios

<!--
Write testable scenarios using Given/When/Then format. Include edge cases like boundary conditions and error scenarios.

Examples:
1. _Given_ a user is on the pricing page, _when_ they click the 'Pro' plan, _then_ they are taken to the checkout page.
2. _Given_ a user enters an invalid email address, _when_ they submit the registration form, _then_ an error message is displayed.
-->

1. _Given_ [initial state], _when_ [action], _then_ [expected outcome]
2. …
